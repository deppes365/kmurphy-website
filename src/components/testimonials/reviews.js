			'"Kristin helped us list and sell our first home and helped us purchase our forever home. Our home sold within the first day of showings and we had multiple offers. She guided us through this process and helped us know what would be best for us and our needs moving forward. We then purchased our dream home within the next week in this crazy market. We couldnâ€™t have done it without her!"',

			'"Kristin helped us buy a home in late 2021 and sell a home in 2022. Throughout the process she was very responsive and knowledgeable about the market and what we were looking for. Her negotiation skills helped us secure an amazing offer on our home. We would definitely want to work with her in the future."',

			'"Kristin did a fantastic job listing our home. She gave us ideas of things to improve, but more importantly gave us great insight into things that should stay. She even brought over her truck to help us empty out the garage on her own time."',
